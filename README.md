# Websocket code for Scratch and Turbowarp websocket connection translated to V!

**Before running the file, create a `.env` file inside the src folder of this repo, which has following contents:**
```
USERNAMEenv="your_scratch_username"
PASSWORDenv="your_scratch_password"
```

so that it can authenticate your user who connects to the project, otherwise scratch rejects the connection to their server.

## Running the file

Run this [scratch-v.v](src/main.v) file:
```bash
v run .
```

-------------

If you don't have V installed, download v compiler here: [https://github.com/vlang/v](https://github.com/vlang/v)
